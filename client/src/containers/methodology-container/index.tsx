              How to interpret a set of scenarios?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Scenarios in the Scenario Compass come from a variety of published studies — an
              &#34;ensemble of opportunity” of what is available, not a representative exploration
              of all possible futures. This means you cannot infer probabilities from their number
              or frequency. The Scenario Compass should be used primarily to understand the
              implications of different assumptions about the future.
